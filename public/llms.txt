# Flow Free Solver

> A web-based solver for Flow Free and Numberlink puzzles using the Z3 Theorem Prover and A* search algorithm.

## What it does
- Solves Flow Free/Numberlink puzzles (5x5 to 15x15 grids)
- Runs entirely in-browser using WebAssembly
- No server required; all computation is client-side

## Algorithms
- Z3 SMT Solver: Constraint satisfaction approach (Microsoft Research)
- A* Search: Heuristic pathfinding with pruning
- Heuristic BFS: Breadth-First Search with pruning

## Features
- Interactive puzzle editor
- Dual solver comparison (Z3 vs A*)
- Real-time solution visualization
- Supports all standard grid sizes (5x5 to 15x15)
